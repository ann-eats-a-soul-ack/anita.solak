      Anita Solak is a poet, writer and editor living and working on unceded Wurundjeri land. 
      She plays with electronic-literature and the failures of language. Her digi-lit, essays 
      and poetry can be found in Australian Multilingual Writing Project, Cordite, Going Down 
      Swinging, Runway Journal, and The Suburban Review among others. When performing poetry 
      she experiments with live interactive literature, creating space for collaborative 
      performances between communities and artists. She was a poetry editor for Voiceworks, a 
      2023 Wheeler Centre Hot Desk Fellow, shortlisted for the 2023 Judith Wright Poetry 
      Prize, studied at the School for Poetic Computation in 2024, and was the Richell Prize
